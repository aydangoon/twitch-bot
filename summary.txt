TwitchBot

;;;; Description ;;;;
TwitchBot is a set of executables for collecting, cleaning, and ultimately displaying an interactive Markov Chain visualization
and text generator from a twitch.tv chat dataset. TwitchBot uses graphs and graph algorithms for storing and interfacing with 
the data as a Markov Chain is essentially a large weighted digraph. Information networks are also a significant part of TwitchBot
as data was collected from livestreams on the world wide web and to collect this information internet protocols like HTTP were 
needed. TwitchBot also made use of information retrieval for storing and accessing around one million unique chat messages and
their associated data. To a lesser extent, TwitchBot handled social networks as data about user's social relationship to the
broadcaster was collected, but we did not incorporate this data into our actual program.

;;;; Work Break Down ;;;;
Allison:
- Worked on Markov Chain visualizer and builder. Specifically, building the graph from data files and in the visualizer handled
camera movement code, global timer and key inputs.
- Wrote code for directed graph data structure. 
- Worked on algorithm for random sentence generation.
Anna:
- Worked on Markov Chain visualizer. 
- Worked with JComponents to build the GUI for visualizer, sentence generator, camera info and
graph info.
- Wrote code for directed graph data structure.
Aydan:
- Nodejs program to collect and store livestream chat data.
- Nodejs program to scrape betterttv.com to get a list of image src URLs for common emote images used on twitch.
- Worked on Markov Chain GUI component, specifically camera and graphics. Also wrote node visual distribution code (Sunflower and UniformSquare).
- Handled emote embedding into string and loading emote image URLs into code.
Henry:
- Python script to clean data. Script stemmed exaggerations, removed links, removed extraneous spaces, spell checking, etc.
- Worked on Markov Chain GUI component, specifically edge and node visuals and the graphics code to draw arrow heads.
- Worked on speed up for Markov Chain Builder to handle larger data sets.
